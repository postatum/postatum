Hey there 👋

My name is Artem and I'm a self-educated web/software developer 👨‍💻

I currently develop web apps and tools 🛠️ with various programming languages (like Python, JavaScript, Go, Scala) and technologies. Over the course of my career I got used to adapting new development instruments and producing quick qualitative results.

I work to do what I love, which is: solving problems 🤯, fixing bugs 🐞 and automating processes 🤖. In my work and personal life I try my best to be empathetic and care about the environment.
